# CodePath Challenge: Community Board

As a Technical Support Representative (TSR) at CodePath, you are tasked with helping students in the community with their technical issues and questions for the courses they are enrolled in.

To help you understand the community's needs, TSRs are required to build the applications of each course they support. This is a great way to learn the material and empathize with the students.

## Challenge

For this project, you will create an events or resources board for your community! Your board should have a unique purpose, such as displaying a list of scheduled games for a sports team or links to help users learn more about software engineering. On each card of your community board, you should display some information about the event or resource.
